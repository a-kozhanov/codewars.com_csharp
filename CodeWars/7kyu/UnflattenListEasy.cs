Unflatten a list (Easy)

There are several katas like "Flatten a list". 
These katas are done by so many warriors, that the count of available list to flattin goes down!

So you have to build a method, that creates new arrays, that can be flattened!

#Shorter: You have to unflatten a list/an array.

You get an array of integers and have to unflatten it by these rules:

- You start at the first number.
- If this number x is smaller than 3, take this number x direct 
  for the new array and continue with the next number.
- If this number x is greater than 2, take the next x numbers (inclusive this number) as a 
  sub-array in the new array. Continue with the next number AFTER this taken numbers.
- If there are too few numbers to take by number, take the last available numbers.
The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.

Example:

 [1,4,5,2,1,2,4,5,2,6,2,3,3] -> [1,[4,5,2,1],2,[4,5,2,6],2,[3,3]]

Steps: 
1. The 1 is added directly to the new array.
2. The next number is 4. So the next 4 numbers (4,5,2,1) are added as sub-array in the new array.
3. The 2 is added directly to the new array.
4. The next number is 4. So the next 4 numbers (4,5,2,6) are added as sub-array in the new array.
5. The 2 is added directly to the new array.
6. The next number is 3. So the next 3 numbers would be taken. There are only 2, 
   so take these (3,3) as sub-array in the new array.
There is a harder version of this kata!

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.
